<h1 align="center">BuckyBall</h1>

The BuckyBall holder is a bespoke device for experimental MR imaging that facilitates the repeatable measurement of a sample at a large number of predefined orientations relative to the static magnetic field. The sample holder is manufactured using 3D printing. This software was developed and is maintained by [Enrico Kaden](https://ekaden.github.io) from University College London.
